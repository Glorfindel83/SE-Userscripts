###[A] Answers just to say thanks / this works
Please don't add "thanks" or "this works" as answers. This *could* be an appropriate post if we were a discussion forum, but we're a Q&A site; answers must provide an answer to the question. Please take a moment to read the [tour]; invest some time in the site and you will gain sufficient [privileges](/privileges/vote-up) to upvote answers you like, which is the $SITENAME$ way of saying thank you.

###[A] Another user with a new problem
If you have a **new** question, please ask it by clicking the [Ask Question](/questions/ask) button. Include a link to this question if it helps to provide context.

###[A] Another user with the same problem
This does not really answer the question. You can [follow](https://meta.stackexchange.com/q/345661/295232) it to be notified of any new answers. If you have enough reputation, you can [upvote](/privileges/vote-up) the question and/or add a [bounty](/help/bounty) to draw more attention to this question.

###[A] Link-only answer
While this may theoretically answer the question, [it would be preferable](https://meta.stackexchange.com/a/8259/295232) to include the essential parts of the answer here, and provide the link for reference. Link-only answers can become invalid if the linked page changes or disappears.

###[A] Requests to OP for further information (<50 rep)

###[A] OP using an answer for further information
Please use the 'Post answer' button only for actual answers. You should modify your original question to add additional information.

###[A] No disclosure
Please note that you must [explicitly state](/help/promotion) that you are affiliated with the product/service/website you're linking to. Otherwise your answer may be deleted as spam.

###[A] Self-promotion
Just linking to your own library or tutorial is not a good answer. Linking to it, explaining why it solves the problem, providing code on how to do so and disclaiming that you wrote it makes for a better answer. See: [What signifies “Good” self promotion?](https://meta.stackexchange.com/q/182212/295232)

### Vandalism

By posting on the Stack Exchange network, you've granted a [non-revocable right for SE to distribute that content](/legal/terms-of-service/public#licensing) under the CC BY-SA 4.0 license.

###[A] Not a discussion forum
This does not provide an answer to the question and is therefore deleted; please take a moment to read the [tour] – we're a Q&A site and not a discussion forum.

# English Language Learners

###[A] No reference
While this may be correct, we like our answers to be backed up by references. You can [edit] your answer to include one (e.g. an online dictionary). See the Help Center article [answer].

###[A] No explanation
Please explain why your answer is correct; answers without explanation don't teach the patterns of English well and [may be deleted](https://ell.meta.stackexchange.com/q/3294/18673).

# Puzzling

###[Q] No attribution
This looks like a puzzle you found elsewhere. For content you did not create yourself, [**proper attribution**](/help/referencing) is required. If you have permission to repost this, please edit to include (at minimum) where it came from, then vote to reopen. Posts which use someone else's content without attribution are generally [**deleted**](https://puzzling.meta.stackexchange.com/q/1348/11110).

###[A] No explanation
Unfortunately, your answer lacks an explanation of why you think it is correct, so it [may be deleted](//puzzling.meta.stackexchange.com/q/1493/11110). Answers should be a thoughtfully considered attempt to solve the puzzle that was posed, with an explanation of how you arrived at the solution and/or why you believe your solution is correct. We're looking for quality answers, not a one-line response containing the first thing that leapt to mind. Please take some time to look around and familiarize yourself with the kinds of answers that are well-received here.
