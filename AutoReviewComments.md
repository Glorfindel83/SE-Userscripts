###[A] Answers just to say thanks / this works
Please don't add "thanks" or "this works" as answers. This *could* be an appropriate post if we were a discussion forum, but we're a Q&A site; answers must provide an answer to the question. Please take a moment to read the [tour]; invest some time in the site and you will gain sufficient [privileges](/privileges/vote-up) to upvote answers you like, which is the $SITENAME$ way of saying thank you.

###[A] Link-only answer
While this may theoretically answer the question, [it would be preferable](https://meta.stackexchange.com/a/8259/295232) to include the essential parts of the answer here, and provide the link for reference. Link-only answers can become invalid if the linked page changes or disappears.

###[A] Requests to OP for further information
This does not provide an answer to the question. To critique or request clarification from an author, leave a comment below their post (this requires [50 reputation](/privileges/comment)).

###[A] OP using an answer for further information
Please use the 'Post answer' button only for actual answers. You should modify your original question to add additional information.

###[A] Another user adding a "Me too!"
If you have a **new** question, please ask it by clicking the [Ask Question](/questions/ask) button. If you have sufficient reputation, you may [upvote](/privileges/vote-up) the question. Alternatively, "follow" it and you will be notified of any new answers.

###[A] No disclosure
Please note that you must [explicitly state](/help/promotion) that you are affiliated with the product/service/website you're linking to. Otherwise your answer may be deleted as spam.

###[Q] Suggest account merge
Please use the [Contact Us](/contact) form to have your accounts merged, to regain full control over your posts.

###[A] No reference
While this may be correct, we like our answers to be backed up by references. You can [edit] your answer to include one (e.g. an online dictionary). See the Help Center article [answer].

###[A] No explanation
Please explain why your answer is correct; answers without explanation don't teach the patterns of English well and [may be deleted](https://ell.meta.stackexchange.com/q/3294/18673).

###[A] Not a discussion forum
This does not provide an answer to the question and is therefore deleted; please take a moment to read the [tour] â€“ we're a Q&A site and not a discussion forum.
